Hi, I am Fahad Khan.

I have tried my best to fullfil all the requirements asked in the assignment.

tools used:
Front End: HTML,CSS, Bootstrap.
Back End: Python, Django.
Database: Sqlite.

It's a fully functional website (except add to cart button).
It includes:
1)Items can be added from database.
2)Searching works fine. You can search any particular elements.
3)Viewing the item. Clicking in view will take to the deatil of product.
4)Paginations- can go from current page to next or previous(if exist).


I have added ten items. Each page contain 8 items.


to run the site: go to the terminal and write: python manage.py runserver
